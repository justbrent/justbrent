Hi, Iâ€™m @justbrent so you can just call me Brent.

Starting out in the world of coding as of today 23/11/2021 I've been busy for exactly 10 days learning from the internet. Signing up here since all the code seems to be here.

In the future, I hope to be employed as a developer, starting off with css and html and going from there. One day would like to do embedded development and program small devices.

Will check back in with a progress report, off to visit the stuff I've had an eye on.
